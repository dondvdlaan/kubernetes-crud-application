Kubernetes CRUD Application

An existing (dockerized) application has been prepared for cloud-native Kubernetes. The application
consits of REACT FE, Nodejs BE and MySQL database. The Docker images from the three parts have been
used in the Kubernetes yaml files to create POD/containers. Kubernetes Minikube has been applied for deployment.

Summary:
- REACT as FE
- Node.js as BE
- MySQL as DB
- Load the Kubernetes files to Minikube and connect to the node via Minikube service <IP><fe>:xxx
